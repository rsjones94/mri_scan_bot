You've requested some processing, but I can't complete the processing using the information and files you've supplied. Here's what seems to be wrong:

<PROBLEMS>

I can't process files if the data and parameters for the processing are incorrectly specified. If you're unsure how to format your processing request, just send an email to this address with the title "Info".

If you don't think this error is due to incorrect specifications, or you still don't understand how to make a request, contact Sky at sky.jones@vumc.org. Thanks!
