Hi! This message is to confirm your processing request. Here's what I understand you need done:

<PROCESSING_REQUESTED>

Processing should take about 15 minutes, after which you will receive another email containing a report and any generated files appropriate to the processing requested. However, if many requests are received at once it may take longer to complete processing. Be patient!

If you have any questions or issues, please contact Sky at sky.jones@vumc.org. Thanks!
